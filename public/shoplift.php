                <p>Trying to search for a particular style or design over here in our community has left our culture in regards to online vendors (e-commerce mainstream) where you can buy anything you want but then the essence to taste in fashion is based on the idea to a particular type of style.</p>
                <p>The information as to fashion hub website in our community does not work, hence online vendors which only showcase different style/trend without proper catalogue of a particular brand/fashion style which can be difficult to navigate; as such, I took this personal project as my first step into UI Design.</p>
                <p>Although, it is a one page design and showcase a landing page feature of what the website does before you get the actual content which as a user must be signed in to access other features or products the website has to offer.</p>
                <p>So, the idea behind the design was to conceptualized a website that has a fashion catalogue and also accomodate e-commerce features to enhance seamless userbility. </p>

            <h3>a. User Story</h3>
            <p>For my design solution, the key experience is the “Style/Design Catolgue”. This is also the least viable feature the product can offer, other features on accessing the e-commerce function is also included in the design setup.</p>

            <h3>b. Wireframing</h3>
            <p>Once I got an understanding of the users, their task and stories, I started sketching design solutions. The process of sketching enables me to visualize different ideas and try out content placement.</p>

            <h3>Brand Colors</h3>
            <p>The mood and emotions to be evoked from the application are those of calm, trendy, elegant, bold and overall uniqueness. As a UI Designer, I can translate these type of colors in unique ways. </p>

                <h3>Hi-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
                <p>For the look and feel I wanted the website to mirror the look and feel of an e-commerce but maintian the fashion catalogue outlook which is predominantly white in colour. For this project, I made it a personal thing as it was my journey into the world of design for the first time.</p>

                <h3>Learning</h3>
                <p>I found this project refreshing as it opened up my mind to different approaches to design process. The key learning for me was seeing the transition of how design can be formed and shaped into information. Found out that proper research, design thinking, and design methodology can help help modulate your workflow or thought process.</p>

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>The next steps will be to design other pending screens which I also currently have to improve the user flow. I would also love to explore some more User Epics for the application, for example, catalogue sections, sign up, on-boarding process, shopping possibilities.</p>
